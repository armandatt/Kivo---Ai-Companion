  {
    question: "Do I need to download an app?",
    answer:
      "No. Kivo runs in your browser: sign up, answer a few questions, and you are on your Today page. If you use Telegram, you can connect it from the dashboard and Nova will message you there as well. Your plan and sessions are the same in both places.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Nova?",
    answer:
      "Nova is Kivo's learning mentor, and every new account works with Nova. It plans your day, runs your focus sessions, keeps track of what is due for review and talks things through with you, in English or Hinglish.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Nova decide what I should study?",
    answer:
      "From what is on record: your subjects and topics, your exam and deadline dates, which topics are due for review, and the time you say you have. It never stretches your day past that time, and when exam work will not fit, it tells you so instead of pretending it does.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does Nova know about me?",
    answer:
      "What you have done in Kivo: your sessions and how you said they went, your topics, tasks and dates. Your notes are yours; Nova reads one only when you ask it to help with that note. What it concludes about how you study is on your Learning DNA page, with how much evidence stands behind it.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the creature work?",
    answer:
      "Your creature goes up a level for every five days you study, and its world stays clear: a week away, or a week ill, never brings fog. It is a picture of your study days, not a score to keep up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Kivo cost anything?",
    answer:
      "Kivo is free to use. There are no paid plans today, so there is nothing to upgrade and no card to enter.",
